# McDriveThru
This is an ongoing project!

## Description
Using the PyQt5 GUI Toolkit, McDriveThru is a project that analyzes drive-thru data from my local McDonald's from August 2021 to August 2024
to visualize the drive-thru order count with Matplotlib and to create a forecasting model and regression model to analyze these order count
trends with the weather. I love data and seeing correlations and trends, which is my main reason for starting this project!

Currently, I'm adding to the GUI and code to further categorize the data to graph by day and by daytime, as well as researching ways to implement
a forecasting and regression model with NumPy and Scikit-learn.
